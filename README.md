# Razer Leviathan
Firmware Fix for the Razer Leviathan's auto off. 

## Description 

This is the firmware fix for the Razer Leviathan. These files came directly from Razer Support's. The firmware updater allows you to use a USB Thumb drive to update the firmware on the Leviathan. 

## Needed 
* 1 - Thumb drive formatted in FAT32 
--note-- fat32 max volume size is only 4 gigs. I have not tested this with exFAT. 
      If you need help with formatting your USB drive refer to the FORMAT-USB-README file. 
* 2 - The beethoven11_v1.0.0.0.mdu file from here. 

## How to update. 
* 1 - Format a USB drive to fat32. (only tested with FAT32) 
* 2 - Put the "beethoven11_v1.0.0.0.mdu" file on the USB. 
* 3 - Unplug all connections from the back of the Leviathan. 
* 4 - Pull cap off "Service Port" on back of the Leviathan. 
* 5 - Plug USB Drive into the "Service Port". 
* 6 - Plug in POWER ONLY
* 7 - The Source lights will cycle (lights to the LEFT of the power button) 
* 8 - When the update is complete all Equalizer lights to the RIGHT of the power button will be lit
* 9 - The update is now complete, remove the power cable from the Sound Bar 
* 10 - Remove the USB drive. 
* 11 - Hook everything back up as normal and enjoy your speakers STAYING ON!!!!!
